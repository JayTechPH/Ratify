Ratify Server Script Documentation
===========================

This Python server script is designed to provide remote control capabilities over a network connection. It allows users to connect to the server, execute commands, and manage various functions remotely. This documentation outlines the script's purpose, usage, setup instructions, and key functionalities.

Purpose:
--------
The server script is intended to facilitate remote control and management of a target system. It listens for incoming connections, receives and processes commands, and can execute actions such as streaming audio/video and interacting with the target system.

Usage:
------
1. Run the server script on the target machine.
2. Clients can connect to the server using a compatible client script.
3. Once connected, clients can send commands to the server for execution.
4. The server processes incoming commands and performs the requested actions.

Setup Instructions:
-------------------
Before using the server script, follow these setup instructions:

1. Ensure Python is installed on the target machine.

2. Install any required dependencies for the script, if not already installed.

3. Configure the `host` and `port` variables in the script to specify the desired network address and port on which the server should listen.

4. Run the server script
